# Forkify

Forkify - A website that allows you to search from Food2fork. And display data about food, how to make it. And what you need it for the recipe.

Forkify was a code-along created with the help of udemy "The Complete JavaScript Course 2018: Build Real Projects!". My front-end template didn't worked this time. I couldn't fix "regeneratorRuntime is not defined" error. Because of it I used tutorial template, to avoid error. This project was way too hard for me. Even as code-along it was hard to keep up.
